# Fire-Detection-using-image-processing
## Overview
Automatically send the message to
near by fire station it helps them to easily identify by
using camera the type of fire and they will able to find
the solution with precautions in urban areas.
Image processing techniques have
been widely used in fire detection systems to enhance
early fire detection and rescue system. By analyzing
images or video footage, these systems can identify and
track the presence of flames or smoke. This abstract
explores various image processing algorithms and
methods employed in fire detection system.
## Key Features
Key Features of the Code:
1. Fire Detection Logic:
Converts the image to HSV color space to detect fire-like colors.
Applies thresholds to isolate colors associated with flames.
2. Noise Removal:
Uses morphological operations (MORPH_CLOSE, MORPH_OPEN) to clean up the mask.
3. Threshold for Detection:
Detects fire if the number of fire-like pixels exceeds a set threshold (500 pixels in this example).
4. Real-Time Monitoring:
Works with a webcam or a pre-recorded video file.
5. Visualization:
Displays the original frame and the fire mask side by side.
Additional Enhancements:
Integration with Alarm: You can add a module to send notifications to a fire station via SMS, email, or IoT devices.
Machine Learning: Use a pre-trained neural network for higher accuracy.

Thermal Imaging: Incorporate infrared camera input to enhance fire detection in low-visibility scenarios.

## Objectives
The integration of
image processing techniques into fire detection systems
has emerged as a powerful tool for early fire detection and
prevention. Traditional fire detection methods often rely
on sensors or manual observation, which may not always
be reliable or timely. Image processing offers a more
proactive approach by analyzing visual data to identify
signs of fire or smoke in real-time. By leveraging
computer vision algorithms and thermal imaging
technology, image processing systems can swiftly detect
the presence of flames or smoke, enabling prompt
response measures to mitigate potential damage and
safeguard lives. This introduction sets the stage for
exploring the application of image processing in fire
detection, highlighting its significance in enhancing fire
safety measures
